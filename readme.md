# JAVASCRIPT STUFF

This repo will content exercises, practices and elements are new for me or they have elements that will be interested to checked.
Also the goal here is to add different topics to make anyone get more ideas about how to solve some practices or get more involved with new stuff or just try new challenges ( it doesn't have to be an difficult one).

The idea is help everybody and wake up the interest to keep practicing.

Keep working, keep practice and it doesn't how fast or slow you're going, enjoy the process.
